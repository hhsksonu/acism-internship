# ACISM Internship – Machine Learning Component Development

This repository contains a detailed report of the work completed during a six-month internship focused on developing modular machine learning components using Python and the Xsemble platform.

## 📚 Overview

The internship involved building over 25 reusable ML components, each designed to handle a specific step in the machine learning pipeline—ranging from data preprocessing and transformation to model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.

Each component was built with production-level modularity and tested using real-world datasets. The work emphasized clean code practices, system integration, and hands-on debugging within the Xsemble framework.
