# 🤖 ACISM Internship Report (Machine Learning Components with Xsemble)

Welcome to the official repository of my 6-month AI/ML internship at **ACISM**.  
This internship focused on developing modular, reusable components for a low-code AI platform called **Xsemble**, with practical work in data preprocessing, model training, inference, and system debugging.

## 🔒 Code Confidentiality Notice

Due to project confidentiality and intellectual property policies, the source code developed during this internship **cannot be publicly shared**.

However, to provide insight into the scope and depth of work done, this repository includes a detailed report summarizing every machine learning component I contributed to during the internship. The report outlines:

- The objective and logic behind each component  
- Implementation details (without disclosing proprietary code)  
- Tools, libraries, and techniques used  
- Key learnings and reflections over the 6-month period

## 🧠 Key Areas of Work

### ✅ Technical Enhancements to Xsemble
- Fixed Python execution and pip versioning issues
- Migrated build setup to `pyproject.toml`
- Solved component folder structure issues
- Improved cross-platform compatibility (especially Windows PATH setup)

### 🔧 Data Preprocessing Pipelines
- Designed and built two modular pipelines:
  1. Initial Pipeline (Basic Preprocessing)
  2. Advanced Pipeline (With subcomponent-level control)

### 🎯 Model Training & Inference (WIP)
- Created UI for algorithm selection and hyperparameter setup
- Started implementing model training, prediction, and inference engines

### 🤝 Collaboration & Mentorship
- Got technical guidance from **Ashish Belagali**
- Received architectural insights and support from **Shubham**
